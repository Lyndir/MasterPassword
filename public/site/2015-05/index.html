        Passwords are frustrating.</h2>

    <p>We all struggle so hard, trying to keep our accounts secure.</p>
    <p>But we're admittedly terrible at it, and what's more, we really don't <i>want</i> to have to bother with it.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>There's a lot of noise about passwords lately.  Accounts of popular people and friends alike getting hacked.  Huge data leaks have become common news.  And every time we're reminded of our need to be good virtual citizens &mdash; <q>keep good passwords</q>, <q>use unique passwords for every site</q>, <q>nothing predictable or simple</q>.  How do we keep up?<br>And even more importantly so, how do we keep safe without sacrificing our freedom for that safety?</p>
    <p>Do you really <i>have</i> passwords?  Or does something or someone else <i>have</i> them for you?</p>

    <h2><img src="/img/password_head.svg" title="https://thenounproject.com/term/password/336886/" />
        A password is something you know,<br>
        not something you have.</h2>

    <p>You walk up to the entrance of an invite-only night club.<br>
    At the entrance, a large man, thick leather vest, stops you in your tracks.  <q>Password, please?</q></p>
    <hr>
    <p>Passwords are secrets which we are expected to remember.  Writing passwords down is highly frowned upon &mdash; and rightly so.  The secret leaves your head and is out in the open.  It's like confiding in your friend, and then she goes and puts it in her diary, which anyone could find.</p>
    <p>Things we know are things we can keep secret, they are locked away safely in our head where none can get to them.<br>
        Things we have, car keys, a badge, the garage remote, are things we can lose or get stolen from us.  We need to keep them safe, protected and always on-hand.  This is a real hassle, and we don't want that headache for our dozens of passwords.</p>
    <p>And yet, we are now expected by websites everywhere, to make and remember secret passwords for each of them, while also making them non-personal and unique?  This is intolerable.  No wonder many of us defect and write our passwords down wherever we can &mdash; often in the form of digital notes or password "vaults".  But this is a panicked reaction to a problem we simply don't know how to handle:<br>The problem of passwords for everything.</p>

    <h2><img src="/img/password_generate.svg" title="https://thenounproject.com/term/expert/861293/" />
        Know one password.<br>
        Generate all the others.</h2>

    <p>Master Password is the answer to the problem websites put on us.</p>
    <p>Master Password is not a password manager.  It is not a secure vault or a digital notebook.  It is something else entirely, and yet something so simple.</p>
    <p>Think of it, as a store-bought calculator.  If your name was <code title="leet">1337</code>, your master password was <code title="lies">5317</code> and your site was named <code title="egg.lol">707.993</code>, take any calculator in the world and type in <code>1337 + 5317 + 707.993</code> to get your site's account password, <code>= 7361.993</code>.<br>
    Master Password performs a similar but <i>cryptographically secure</i> operation, while making everything else easy for you.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Now, remember only your name and one password.  Your master password.  Forget everything else.</p>
    <p>With Master Password you leave no passwords laying around.  You no longer store passwords in commercial, proprietory apps and no longer send them off to the cloud.  You are no longer tied to your laptop or the internet if you need to look one up.  Even if a personal or natural catastrophe causes you loss, you can never lose your account passwords &mdash; all you ever need is your one and only master password and anyone's Master Password calculator.</p>

    <h1>Passwords are terrible,<br>
        Password managers are too.</h1>

        <p>
        Master Password is not a password manager.
        </p>
        <p>
        Passwords have slowly become regarded as a "necessary evil" to having accounts online.  We accept they are they way things are done and try to adapt.  But upon inspection, we find that we do so very poorly.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        Take a little test to see how Master Password can help you:
        <ul>
            <li class="item_toggler">
                <input type="checkbox" id="mp_test_1">
                <label for="mp_test_1">My accounts are not too well protected.  I don't use cryptographically secure unique passwords for each site.</label>
                <p class="toggle_item">
                    Master Password was designed to generate high-entropy cryptographically strong and unique passwords for each of your sites.<br>
                    Stop trying to think of good passwords for your sites and just use the password created for the site by Master Password.  Your accounts will become as safe as they can be against hacks, hoaxes and leaks.

        <p>
        Master Password returns us to how passwords were supposed to be done.<br>
        Instead of using the same password for every site, or using random passwords that need to be saved securely; Master Password does away with all of this, lets you remember only a single password, and doesn't make you depend on a website, your hard disk - not even the internet.
        </p>

        <p>
        Master Password's unique approach makes you safer from loss, theft, problems with backups, sync, confiscation, snooping, and more.

        <p>
        How does it work?<br>
        Instead of storing passwords in the app, Master Password acts as little more than a deterministic password calculator.  You log in with your name and master password and the app gives you the passwords to use for your sites.
        </p>

        <p>
        Nothing is stored on your phone - passwords are simply the result of a cryptographic algorithm.  If your phone breaks down or is lost, you can use any other phone or app to get to your passwords: a friend's, spouse's or even stranger's, without needing internet access and without leaving your passwords behind anywhere after usage.<br>
        If your phone is taken from you or copied, you can rest assured: your passwords aren't even on it.
        </p>

        <p>
        Master Password needs to be adopted.<br>
        Since using Master Password is completely different from using a password manager, adopting Master Password means you'll need to go through a phase of updating the passwords of your existing sites to secure Master Password-generated versions.  Master Password for iOS and Mac currently support a hybrid mode that allows you to store custom passwords in the app, similar to regular password managers, but note that these types of passwords are not protected by the guarantees regular
        Master Password protected account passwords have.
