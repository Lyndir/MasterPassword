Webpack build
=============

In order to run the web version of MasterPassword, you'll need to first build it using webpack.

1. Install npm.  On OS X, you can use `brew install npm`.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Build the ES5 translation of your code (including polyfills) by running `npm run build:prod`.
